# 📖 About

LUMIXA AI is an AI-powered Knowledge Assistant , designed to transform information from multiple sources into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The application enables users to upload **YouTube videos, PDF documents, websites, and plain text**, then interact with their knowledge through AI-powered summaries, contextual conversations, and semantic search.

Instead of relying solely on Large Language Models, LUMIXA AI retrieves the most relevant information from a custom knowledge base before generating responses, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

Built with a modular architecture, the project demonstrates practical implementation of modern AI engineering concepts including semantic search, vector embeddings, context engineering, prompt engineering, and conversational memory.
